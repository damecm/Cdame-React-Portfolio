        What is one area Campbell would like see cleaned up or see more efficiency from the last four games of the season?

        Campbell said first and foremost he'd like to see more efficiency in the run game on offense.

        "We have to have better run efficiency on offense, that's a definite," he said. "Doesn't mean we have to run the ball more. We need to be much more efficient, and we can be with those guys up front and our tight ends and backs."

        The Lions rushed for 134 yards against the Vikings on Sunday, but 42 of those yards came on a fake punt run by Moore. Detroit averaged just 3.2 yards per carry against the Jaguars Week 13, 3.4 yards per carry against the Bills Week 12 and 3.1 yards per carry Week 10 against the Bears.

        The efficiency of quarterback Jared Goff and the passing game has kind of masked some of the inconsistency in the run game over the last month, per Campbell.

        He also mentioned defensively how getting takeaways have been good for them, but he'd like to see a little better consistency on first and second downs to help close out opponent drives quicker.

        On special teams, Campbell thinks they've left a lot of yards on the field in the return game and would like to see them pop a big one for a touchdown in one of these last four games.
